Scampy is an email chatbot designed to engage 419 scammers and distract their attention from real victims. 

Scampy's original design, including bayesian classification of scams and targeted scripts, was abandoned in the light of the unreasonable effectiveness of randomly selected responses.

Scampy currently sends 10-20 emails per day and is limited only by the low number of incoming scams. By default only gmail is supported but any imap mailbox can be used with a little effort.
