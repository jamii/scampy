I am thinking that you have the wrong person as this doesnt seem to be intended for me.
###
Sir, this does not appear to be a reputable transaction and I cannot risk getting involved with things that are illegal.
###
Can you reassure me as to this being legal. I do not wish to get into any trouble over this.
###
Dear, you have already contacted me on this matter. Surely you are not forgetting me already. This is unforgiveable
###
Can you tell me whether I should be expecting further contact from you on this matter?
###
I have to ask if you are correct in this matter as you seem to be not very clear on your understanding here.
###
This is very exciting business. I am glad that you came to me with this as I am very discreet in such dealings. Here is to good business dealings with you for a lengthy time.
###
Excellent, I shall get back to you shortly.
###
Can you please explain this more clearly because I am not understanding you. Especially on the first point that you mentioned, I think that you may have written wrongly because it does not seem correct.
###
Dear, you did not answer my question. Please do not think that I will forget just because you ignore it. Answer my question or I will cancel the money order.
###
Please be providing some identification so that I know you are who you claim.
###
Are you needing my address? Should I send it to you?
###
Can you please the clarify the process by which all this will happen. I am finding it very confusing.
###
I do understand what you are saying. I think perhaps you're english is not very good but I will make an effort to be interpreting. I am not speaking english so well myself so I well understand your predicament.
###
Do you need me to send you my bank details to help further this arrangement.
###
Thankyou so much for your quick message. I will dwell on what you are saying and return to you in the future.
###
I am worried that this may not be legal. I have been talking to my lawyer and he tells me that I need to take your phone number and address so that he can contact you. Please to be sending these.
###
I am very excited to be partnered with you in this business dealing. Please be quick in supplying further details so that we can progress this more faster.
###
Today is a good day indeed, for god has blessed us with such fortunes. Praise be!
###
I need you to promise me that you are not a scammer. My friends say that you are but I think that they are just being jealous of my good fortune. Can you promise me that on your life?
